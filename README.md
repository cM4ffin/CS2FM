# CS2FM
**CS2FM** is a tool that you can use to change your CS2 Font, and is a project I've made for fun.

### Features:
- Ability to preview font and font size,
- Ability to add or remove font paths,
- Automatic "core" and "game" path detection (works on all drives),
- Ability to work standalone without any installations,

*and many more...*

## How to use?
1. Download a font file from anywhere you like, for example you can use [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/).
2. After downloading a font file extract it.
3. Click "Auto Detect Paths", or if that doesn't work select "Core" and "Game" paths manually.
4. Open the application and click "Add" then select the font file from the dialogue menu (or you can drag and drop if you want to).
5. If done correctly, you should see your font listed. Click on it to select it.
6. Adjust the font size, if you want to that is.
7. Click on "Apply Selected Font."

Now close Counter Strike 2 if you have it running and launch it again. If everything went well you should see your font applied.
